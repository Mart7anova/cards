# Cards

https://mart7anova.github.io/cards/

This project was developed to teach new skills using a card system. The algorithm is as follows: 
1. add a new pack,
2. add cards to it with questions that need to be learned and answers to them,
3. Click the "learn" button.

The application will show you the cards in random order (well, or almost, the cards with the lowest rating will be shown a little more often than those that you have already learned).

Have fun learning!
